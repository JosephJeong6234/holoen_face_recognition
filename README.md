This was making a virtual youtuber face classification model, which recognize a person based on its face. I first found videos off of youtube with the youtuber, then downloaded the videos. Then I took the first couple frames from each video. Then from those frames I found the faces on those frames using anime-face-detector and cropped them so only the faces were there. Finally, I built a face classifying deep-learning model based on mobilenetv2 and trained it by feeding the face images which I extracted from the videos. The modelâ€™s accuracy was only 20% because l the number of the training images was only 200s and the faces were kind of similar. To improve the accuracy, I will collect more face images, more than 10k. Also, I will change the base model from mobilenetv2 to resnet50 or vision transformer, which will require more computing power but have deeper neural architecture.
